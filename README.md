## Solution brief
To give a better user experience to the end-user, required interactivity for the user reaction. This calculator required a reactive style solution because when input values change Start Balance projection graph and Projection data table should be updated. That is my main intention for starting this solution, which gives the user experience better.

I have created a service, which is handling the communication between form input updates to components.
